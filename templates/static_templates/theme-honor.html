Certificates will be issued by Cloud Genius under the name of the partner institution from where the course was delivered, i.e. LWTech.edu, NIU.edu, etc. The decision whether a Certificate will be awarded to a given student will be solely within the discretion of Cloud Genius and its partner institutions. Cloud Genius and/or the partner institution providing courses on the Site may choose not to offer a Certificate for some courses.
</p>
<h3>Registration and Payment.</h3>
<p>
Subject to the foregoing, you may be required to pay a fee to receive an ID Verified Certificate of Achievement (a “Verified Certificate”) with respect to certain courses on the Site, in which case, the following processes and requirements shall apply:</p>

<p>As part of your registration, you will be prompted to submit a photo of yourself, along with one other form of photo identification (“photo ID”). Although these items are collected by Cloud Genius in accordance with these TOS and the Cloud Genius Privacy Policy, you should be aware that the actual authentication of your identity is performed by an Cloud Genius third party service provider. Please refer to the Privacy Policy for additional details on how we handle those items once received by us.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the processing of your payment information is done by an Cloud Genius third party vendor, and you will be re-routed to a secure website to complete the payment transaction. The privacy statement posted at the payment landing page operated by such third party vendor will govern the submission and processing of your payment details. Please familiarize yourself with those terms prior to initiating a transaction.
</p>
<p>

Once your payment transaction is completed, you will be re-routed back to an Cloud Genius confirmation page and will receive a confirmation email with your name, order number and the payment amount. Please retain this email for your records as this information will be required if you seek a refund from Cloud Genius, as described below.
</p>
<h3>Course Withdrawal and Refunds.</h3>

<p>
For a period of fourteen (14) calendar days from the course start date (“Drop Period”), you may withdraw or unregister from the course by clicking on the unregister link on the student dashboard and request a refund by emailing hello at cloudgeni.us. Please include your full name and order number in your email request. Refunds will be credited to the credit card used when you registered and may take up to two billing cycles to process. Cloud Genius has no obligation to issue a refund after the Drop Period, but if you believe a refund is warranted, please email us at hello at cloudgeni.us
</p>
<h3>No Other Enrollment.</h3>
<p> When you take a course through Cloud Genius, you will not be an applicant for admission to, or enrolled in, any degree program of the partner as a result of registering for or completing a course provided by such partner through Cloud Genius. You will not be entitled to use any of the resources of the partner beyond the online courses provided on the Site, nor will you be eligible to receive student privileges or benefits provided to students enrolled in degree programs of the partner.</p>

<h3>
AUTHENTICATION</h3>

<p>In order that Cloud Genius can authenticate your identity as required by these TOS, you will be prompted to take a webcam photo of yourself, as well as a photo of an acceptable form of photo ID (described below). Once submitted to Cloud Genius, this information will be subject to the Cloud Genius Privacy Policy and will be used only for the purpose of verifying your identity.</p>

<p> Acceptable forms of photo ID’s are:</p>

<ul><li>Government or State-issued driver’s license
</li><li>Passport
</li><li>National ID card
</li><li>Military ID card
</li><li>State or Province ID card (including cards issued by motor vehicle agencies)
</li>
<ul>
<br/>
<p>In order to be accepted by Cloud Genius, your photo ID must:</p>

<ul><li>Contain your full name exactly (excluding hyphens, accents and spaces)
</li><li>Contain a relatively current photograph of yourself
</li><li>Be an original document; photocopied documents cannot be accepted
</li><li>Be current and valid; expired documents cannot be accepted
</li></ul>
